# CamoStyle
This is a draft sample style for use w/ Tegola/Maputnik.

- Toggle off visibility of building extrusion data layer for flat viewing, toggle on for tilt
- Will we want a url for our own sprites and fonts/glyphs?
- Clipping issues at zoom 15 & higher to be fixed soon
- The bonn_lakes data layer is missing a few pieces of the Rhine River
- If Maputnik doesn't recenter for you, try #11.5/50.7377/7.1119
